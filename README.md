# The Complete Roguelike Tutorial 2021 Project

> A "playable" version of this repository is available here: [5310.github.io/crt21](https://5310.github.io/crt21)

This repository contains the result of the [r/roguelikedev 2021 run of The Complete Roguelike Tutorial](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/o5x585/roguelikedev_does_the_complete_roguelike_tutorial/) that @onnyyonn and I decided to do.

Except that we decided early on to skip "_that whole Python situation_" for various reasons and instead follow [RedBlogGames' JavaScript version of the 2020 run of the tutorial](https://www.redblobgames.com/x/2025-roguelike-dev/).

(Not sure why his URL was in the far future of 2025 back there; but then time is an illusion, 2020 in particular...)
